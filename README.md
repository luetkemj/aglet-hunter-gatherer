# Aglet Hunter Gatherer

API & UI for hunting and gathering in tabletop rpgs.

[Demo](http://aglet.io/tools/hunter-gatherer/)

Very much a WIP.

Example forage output: "You found a days worth of rations that will make you sick."

Example hunt output: "1 medium game found at 50 yards. 0 game killed with 3 missiles used."
